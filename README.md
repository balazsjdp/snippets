# Document Consent Feature

The **Document Consent** feature is a module I designed and developed end-to-end, starting from the initial planning phase through to implementation.

## Overview

When a user joins the application, they are required to review and approve certain documents before gaining full access. These documents may include terms of service, privacy agreements, or other legal/mandatory information.

In addition to the main documents, each document can contain **sub-sections** (e.g., optional clauses or specific conditions). Users are able to **individually reject or accept these sub-sections**, providing a more flexible and transparent consent flow.
